Tree Structure:
* We should have "projects", where the user could store the todos for a certain subject
* each "project" must be under a "category", the user is not required to create a category, the default category is called "root" that means the "project" is in the no root with no category
* Should be able to move projects to a different category

Screens:
1. no-project
  ui: there is no project, create one?, an input for creating a project
  once the project is created move to the tasks view of that project
2. projects
  * there are projects and categories, there is an input where the user could search for projects
  * there is a tree structure under the input where the user could find the project manually
  * crud for project
  * crud for category
  * move project between categories
3. tasks
  * there is four columns, "todo", "doing", "done" and "wont-do"
  * do basic crud for tasks

Data Structures:
Task: title, description, id, project_id
  id is the primary key, the title in each project must be unique
project: title, id, category_id
  id is the primary key, title should be unique
Category: title, id
